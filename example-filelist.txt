# FastCopy File List Example
# Format: source|destination (one pair per line)
# Lines starting with # are ignored
# Empty lines are also ignored

# Example 1: Copy a single file
/path/to/source/file1.txt|/path/to/destination/file1.txt

# Example 2: Copy to a different name
/home/user/documents/report.pdf|/backup/reports/report-2026-02-13.pdf

# Example 3: Copy multiple files
/data/logs/app.log|/backup/logs/app.log
/data/logs/error.log|/backup/logs/error.log
/data/logs/access.log|/backup/logs/access.log

# Example 4: Cross-directory copies
/srv/www/index.html|/backup/www/index.html
/srv/www/style.css|/backup/www/style.css

# Notes:
# - Destination directories are created automatically if they don't exist
# - Use absolute or relative paths
# - Speed limit (--limit) applies globally to all files combined
# - Files are processed in parallel based on CPU cores
